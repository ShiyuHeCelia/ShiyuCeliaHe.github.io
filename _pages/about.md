I am a postdoctoral researcher in **psycholinguistics and cognitive psychology**, working in the field of **eye movements during reading**. My research focuses on the **real-time dynamics of reading**, examining how eye movements reflect the moment-by-moment allocation of attention and processing as written language unfolds. A central theme of my work is understanding how **linguistic experience, proficiency, and exposure shape individual differences in eye-movement behaviour during reading**, particularly across languages and writing systems.

I am currently an **ESRC-funded Postdoctoral Research Fellow** at **Royal Holloway, University of London**, working with **Prof. Kathy Rastle** and collaborators on projects investigating **visual word recognition and reading behaviour across languages and orthographies**. Alongside this role, I have extensive experience in **experimental design, eye-tracking methodology, advanced quantitative data analysis, and research methods training**.

## Research interests

My research lies at the intersection of **psycholinguistics, vision science, and cognitive psychology**, with a primary focus on **eye movements during reading**. I am interested in how reading unfolds over time and how the temporal dynamics of eye movements are shaped by linguistic structure, experience, and individual variation.

A defining feature of my work is its **comparative and cross-linguistic perspective**. I have studied reading across typologically diverse languages and scripts, including **Chinese, English, Arabic, Estonian, Russian, Polish, Punjabi, and Medieval Spanish**, using cross-linguistic variation as a tool to investigate how the human reading system adapts to different structural and experiential constraints.

Specific research interests include:

- Eye-movement control and temporal dynamics during reading  
- Visual word recognition in continuous text  
- Parafoveal and foveal processing during reading  
- First- and second-language reading  
- Individual differences in eye-movement behaviour  
- Cross-linguistic and cross-script comparisons in reading  
- Experimental and quantitative approaches to modelling reading processes

## Methods and expertise

I work primarily with experimental and quantitative approaches, including:

- Eye-movement recording and analysis during reading across laboratory and online settings (EyeLink systems; Tobii Pro, Tobii Fusion, Tobii Glasses; Gazepoint portable eye trackers; online eye-tracking methods)  
- Experimental design in PsychoPy, Gorilla, OpenSesame, and Qualtrics  
- Statistical modelling in R (mixed-effects models, generalized additive mixed models, principal component analysis, clustering)  
- Data visualisation and reproducible research workflows

## Teaching and academic service

I have taught and supported a wide range of undergraduate and postgraduate courses in psychology and linguistics, with particular emphasis on **research methods, experimental design, and quantitative data analysis**. I also regularly deliver **workshops and technical training** on eye-tracking methodology, experimental software, and data analysis for students and researchers.
