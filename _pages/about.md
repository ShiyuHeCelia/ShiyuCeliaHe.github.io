I am a postdoctoral researcher in psycholinguistics and cognitive psychology, specialising in eye-tracking, reading, and language processing. My research focuses on how readers extract and integrate information from written text, with particular attention to individual differences, second-language processing, and cross-linguistic influence.

I am currently an ESRC-funded Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Royal Holloway, University of London, working with Prof. Kathy Rastle and collaborators on projects investigating visual word recognition and reading behaviour across languages and writing systems. Alongside this role, I have extensive experience in experimental design, quantitative data analysis, and research methods training.

## Research interests

My research sits at the intersection of psycholinguistics, vision science, and cognitive psychology. Broadly, I am interested in how linguistic knowledge, exposure, and experience shape real-time reading behaviour.

Specific interests include:

- Eye-movement control in reading  
- Visual word recognition and lexical processing  
- First- and second-language reading  
- Individual differences in language processing  
- Experimental and quantitative methods in psychology

## Teaching and academic service

I have taught and supported a wide range of undergraduate and postgraduate courses in psychology and linguistics, particularly in research methods, experimental design, and data analysis. I also regularly deliver workshops and technical training on eye-tracking and experimental software.
