I attended the **Architectures and Mechanisms for Language Processing (AMLaP)** conference, where I had the opportunity to present my work on bilingual reading and eye movements.

At the conference, I presented both a **talk** and a **poster** based on my ongoing research examining how second-language (L2) proficiency and exposure can reshape native-language (L1) reading processes. Using eye-tracking, the study investigates how classic lexical variables such as word frequency and word length interact with bilingual experience during natural reading.

The talk focused on evidence showing that highly proficient L2 English readers may exhibit **reduced automaticity in L1 Chinese reading**, reflected in longer fixation durations, particularly for low-frequency and longer words. These effects were strongest at the fixated word and attenuated in parafoveal and spill-over regions, suggesting changes in early lexical processing rather than global reading difficulty.

Alongside the talk, the poster allowed for in-depth discussion with researchers working on bilingualism, reading, and visual word recognition. It was especially rewarding to exchange ideas about how L2 immersion and proficiency relate to **L1 attrition**, and how eye-movement measures can provide sensitive indicators of subtle changes in reading behaviour.

Overall, AMLaP was a stimulating and supportive environment, offering valuable feedback and new perspectives on my work. Presenting both a talk and a poster at the conference was an important milestone, and the discussions will directly inform the next stages of analysis and writing.
