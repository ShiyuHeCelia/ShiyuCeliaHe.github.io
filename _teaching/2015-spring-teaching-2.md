I have extensive teaching experience across psychology, linguistics, and quantitative research methods, spanning undergraduate, postgraduate, and researcher training. My teaching is strongly research-led, with a particular focus on experimental design, eye-tracking methodology, and quantitative data analysis.

## Teaching Technician (University of Bristol)

In my current role as Teaching Technician in the School of Psychological Science, I support and deliver teaching in research methods, experimental design, and data analysis for undergraduate and postgraduate students. A core part of my role involves hands-on training in experimental platforms and research workflows used in contemporary psychological science.

I provide teaching and practical support in:

- **Experimental design and implementation**, including between- and within-subject designs, counterbalancing, randomisation, and reproducibility  
- **Online and laboratory-based experiment building** using **Gorilla**, **Qualtrics**, and **Experiment Builder**  
- **Eye-tracking methodology**, including task design, stimulus preparation, calibration procedures, and data quality control  
- **Quantitative data analysis**, teaching **R**, **SPSS**, and **G*Power** for statistical modelling, power analysis, and transparent reporting  

I regularly run workshops, drop-in sessions, and one-to-one support clinics for students developing dissertations and research projects, helping them translate theoretical research questions into robust experimental designs.

Alongside teaching delivery, I also support the pedagogical infrastructure of the School by providing training in **research ethics**, **health and safety**, and **risk assessment**, ensuring that student and staff projects meet institutional and professional standards.

## Graduate Teaching Fellow (University of Birmingham)

As a Graduate Teaching Fellow, I supervised postgraduate MA dissertations focused on interpreting and translation practices. I provided detailed academic feedback, supported students through the research and writing process, and contributed to assessment and marking in line with departmental criteria.

## Data Literacy Educator (University of Birmingham)

I taught on the University of Birmingham Skills Bootcamp as a Data Literacy Educator, delivering applied training in data analysis for students from creative and non-technical backgrounds. Teaching focused on:

- Introduction to **R programming**
- Data manipulation and visualisation using **RStudio** and the **tidyverse**
- **R Markdown** for reproducible research and reporting
- **Data communication** and interpretation for non-specialist audiences  

This role strengthened my experience in inclusive, practice-oriented teaching and in supporting students with diverse academic backgrounds.

## Teaching Assistant and Teaching Associate (University of Birmingham)

I previously worked as a Teaching Assistant for undergraduate data mining modules, where I led workshops, prepared teaching materials in R and Python, and provided hands-on technical support to students. As a Teaching Associate, I delivered small-group language tutorials in online and blended formats, fostering student engagement and confidence in academic discussion.

My teaching philosophy emphasises clarity, methodological rigour, and confidence-building. I aim to equip students not only with technical skills, but also with the ability to critically evaluate research design, data, and evidence in psychological and linguistic science.
